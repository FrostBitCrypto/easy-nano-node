# Frequently asked questions

## Q&A

### Node isn't synced
Let it node sync the full ledger, this can take some hours. You can always compare to the current block count [here](https://www.nanode.co/blocks).

### Account not opened
The account has no transactions in the ledger. Send some Nano to the address to open it.

### Nano isn't received
The Nano node has a configurable receive minimum which is at default 1 Nano. You can set it in the config.json (`~/RaiBlocks/config.json`). [More information at the wiki](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/config.json).

### How do I send Nano from the node account?
The easiest way is entering the account seed into a web wallet like [NanoVault](https://nanovault.io/). You can also use the [RPC interface](https://github.com/nanocurrency/raiblocks/wiki/RPC-protocol#send).
